### Project Description
```
FHEVM Private Voting dApp

A complete decentralized voting application that demonstrates the power of FHEVM (Fully Homomorphic Encryption Virtual Machine) technology. This dApp ensures complete privacy for individual votes while maintaining transparency in final results.

Key Features:
- Privacy-preserving voting using FHEVM encryption
- Individual votes remain encrypted and private
- Transparent and verifiable final results
- Modern React frontend with wallet integration
- Smart contract implementation with FHEVM integration
- Real-time poll management and voting

Technical Implementation:
- Smart Contract: Solidity with FHEVM library integration
- Frontend: Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- Wallet Integration: RainbowKit, Wagmi
- Privacy: FHEVM for encrypted vote processing
- Blockchain: Ethereum-compatible networks

The application showcases how FHEVM can be used to create privacy-preserving applications while maintaining the transparency and verifiability that blockchain technology provides. Users can cast votes knowing their individual choice remains private, while the final results are publicly verifiable.

This project demonstrates a real-world use case for FHEVM technology in governance and decision-making applications.
